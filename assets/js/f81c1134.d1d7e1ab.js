Those elements could be java classes grouped by the responsibility type\\nthey manage and respect the rule that each layer should depend only on the layer below it, Another version also tolerate that a layer can\\ndepends on the any of the layers below it.\\n\\nEven though we can apply this architecture style to any of the 4 model view we\'ve seen above, It is most likely to be used in the logical view\\nas follows:\\n\\n* __Presentation layer__: groups classes & interfaces that handle the UI interactions, Such as desktop application UI that handles user interactions like Click, Press, etc...\\n* __Business logic layer__: contains classes where we implement the business logic of the system. For example classes that calculate the shortest route for delivering merchandise from stock house to customer.\\n* __Persistence layer__: contains interfaces and classes that interact with database or file system. For example classes that communicate with a MySQL database.\\n\\n![3 Tier Java Application Architecture](/img/blog/n-tier-architecture-style-java.jpg)\\n<i>In the above figure, we illustrate the 3 tier architecture for a java application, classes of the same layer are grouped using packages.Note that architecture is beyond\\nany programming language, so for example in case of a C# application we group classes in namespaces instead of packages for java.</i>\\n\\nThe years go by and the software development community began to recognize some drawbacks of N Tier architecture, below we list some of them:\\n\\n- __Single Presentation Layer__: With the evolution of the web and mobile applications, many systems provide the same functions, For example a desktop application\\n    for logistics providing the feature of calculating the shortest route and cost of a delivery, While the business logic remains the same, \\n    the interactions with the system are evolving with mobile and web users.\\n- __Single Persistence Layer__: Modern systems needs to interact with many and/or different storage systems rather than one database.\\n- __Layer dependencies__: As the business logic depends on the persistence one, we are prevented from testing the business logic in an isolation.\\n\\nThese disadvantages lead to an alternative architecture style we present next.\\n\\n## The Hexagonal Architecture Style\\nThis architecture style organizes the logical view in a way that puts the business logic at the center. In contrast to the layered\\narchitecture that has a presentation layer, we have here one or more inbound adapters that handle requests from the outside by invoking\\nthe business logic. The same applied to the persistence layer, the application has or more outbound adapters that are invoked by the business logic and invoke external applications.\\nThe main characteristic of this architecture style is that the business logic doesn\'t depend on these adapters, instead they depend on it.\\nThe Business logic has one or more ports.A __port__ defines a set of operations and is how the business logic interacts with\\nwhat\'s outside it. For example in java these ports are a Java Interface. we distinguish inbound and outbound ports. An inbound port is an API exposed by\\nthe business logic, which enables it to be invoked by external applications, for example a REST API.An outbound port is how the business\\nlogic invokes external systems like Database Access Repositories.\\n\\nLike the ports there are inbound and outbound adapters. An inbound adapter handles requests from the outside world\\nby invoking an inbound port. For example in the case of a Java Web Application using Spring framework, An inbound\\nadapter is a Rest Controller that will invoke inbound port exposed by the business logic.\\nAn outbound adapter implements an outbound port and handles requests from the business logic by invoking an external\\napplication or service.An example of an outbound adapter is an Event Publisher to Kafka or any other Event streaming system.\\n\\n![Hexagonal Architecture](/img/blog/hexagonal-architecture.jpeg)\\n\\n*The Figure above shows an example of the hexagonal architecture where the business logic has one or more adapters to communicate with external systems*\\n\\nLet me remind you that decoupling the business logic from the presentation and data access is the important benefit\\nof the hexagonal architecture style. This is very useful also when it comes to testing as you can use <abbr title=\\"Test Driven Development\\">__TDD__</abbr>\\neasily as you can test your business logic in an isolation.It also defines new model for the modern applications where the \\nbusiness logic can be invoked by multiple adapters each one of them invokes an external system.\\n\\n> The Hexagonal Architecture style is well fit to define the architecture of each service in a microservice architecture.\\n\\nBoth the layered and hexagonal architectures are a set of constraints and rules on how elements within the logical\\nview are connected and how they communicate.\\n\\n----\\n\\n* [Software Architecture Definition by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture)\\n* [The \u201c4+1\u201d View Model of Software Architecture by Philippe Kruchten](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/teaching/papers/4+1view-architecture.pdf)\\n* [Advancing the Practice of Software Architecture by Software Engineering Institute](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/our-work/software-architecture/)"},{"id":"devops-strengthen-your-digital-transformation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/devops-strengthen-your-digital-transformation","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-10-devops-strengthen-your-digital-transformation.mdx","title":"DevOps: Strengthen your digital transformation","description":"author","date":"2021-07-10T10:49:31.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"devops","permalink":"/blog/tags/devops"},{"inline":true,"label":"agile","permalink":"/blog/tags/agile"}],"readingTime":6.275,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Reda Jaifar","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/reda-jaifar","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10919693?s=400&u=b30e8e86baebe277b11a4117560d601fd34bd245&v=4","key":"reda","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"devops-strengthen-your-digital-transformation","title":"DevOps: Strengthen your digital transformation","date":"2021-07-10 10:49:31 +0100","authors":["reda"],"tags":["devops","agile"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Software Architecture: The Logical View","permalink":"/blog/software-architecture-logical-view"},"nextItem":{"title":"Software testing from separate activity to core development","permalink":"/blog/software-testing-from-separate-activity-to-core-development\\""}},"content":"import \'./styles.css\';\\n\\n![author](/img/blog/devops-strengthen-your-digital-transformation.jpeg)\\n[photo source](https://www.sdxcentral.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=748,h=399,fit=scale-down,f=auto,q=85/https://www.sdxcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cloudera-Hortonworks-Merge-Their-Big-Data-Efforts.jpg)\\n\\n\\nNowadays the processes used to create software have been considerably evolved from manual and human interaction to test,\\nbuild and deploy an application to a fully automated process relying on new practices and tools that help teams to \\ndeliver an update to production in few minutes or even seconds.\\nIf your organization or team still using the old methods and have the willingness to take a step toward these useful\\nand helpful DevOps practices, there are some notions to consider while taking the way.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n# DevOps: Development and Operations fusion\\nDevOps aims at merging or combining the software development and IT operations to accelerate software delivery while ensuring high quality and secure systems.\\nwith the adoption of agility, a team could respond to customer requirements rapidly without suspending the production environment. I would like to sum up these concepts as follow:\\n\\n   - Development and operations teams are merged into one single team where all members contributing to make\\n     the app ready to use, from dev, and test to deployment.\\n   - Product Owner and other functional roles are concerned by DevOps practices, they decide and act from feature\\n     development to application production deployment. \u200b\\n\\nBefore detailing the concepts and practices of DevOps, let\'s share some of the key benefits of either a company or an open community\\ndeveloping a product can gain.\\n\\n<div class=\\"row\\">\\n  <div class=\\"column\\">\\n    <div class=\\"card\\">\\n      <h3>Speed</h3>\\n      <p class=\\"card-content\\">Increase your velocity for faster innovation and market-changing responding by releasing updates quickly</p>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\\"column\\">\\n    <div class=\\"card\\">\\n      <h3>Delivery</h3>\\n      <p class=\\"card-content\\">Reducing the delivery time to provide customer with new features and fixing bugs quickly</p>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  \\n  <div class=\\"column\\">\\n    <div class=\\"card\\">\\n      <h3>Security</h3>\\n      <p class=\\"card-content\\">\\n      Respond and deliver quicker without losing control on quality and compliance, by including automated quality and security checking\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  \\n  <div class=\\"column\\">\\n    <div class=\\"card\\">\\n      <h3>Reliability</h3>\\n      <p class=\\"card-content\\">Manage your development, test and production environment in a managed manner to test that every changes or updates is functional so the end user is always provided with a reliable product </p>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n## DevOps practices\\n# Continuous Integration\\nToday chances that software is writing by more than one person are higher contrary to the shining start of the Linux story who was\\ncreated first by Linus Torvalds as a personal project. To merge code writing by different members we use the continuous integration\\nwhich is a simple idea about committing code frequently to a shared central repository on a server, then an automated conflicts resolving,\\ntest and build are triggered, this practice keeps developers focused on writing code for new features rather than debugging code merging issues\\nToday the market is full of different products that we can rely on for managing source code and continuous integration, the most famous\\nare:\\n\\n- [Github](https://github.com/)\\n- [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com)\\n- [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/)\\n- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)\\n- [Google Cloud Source Repositories](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories)\\n\\n# Continuous Delivery\\nTime to market is a key factor many businesses usually is taking into consideration, they were always interested in how to\\ntest an idea ASAP and put that product or service in customer\'s hand and gather a quick feedback. To collect a reliable\\nfeedback and analysis how the user interact with the software there is a need to provide it in a real production environment.\\nContinuous Delivery also known as CD respond to this requirement and more through the adoption of a set of practices and tools\\nthat they will help your organization to automatically build, test and deploy a new version or small change to production\\nrapidly.\\nFind below some of the most used CI/CD platforms:\\n\\n- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)\\n- [Gitlab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)\\n- [AWS CodePipelines](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/)\\n- [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/)\\n- [Google Cloud Source Repositories](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories)\\n\\n## More than CI/CD\\nWhile the continuous integration and delivery remain the most known practices of DevOps, There are others not less important\\nand should be implemented and adopted to have a standard compliant Workflow as illustrated in the following drawing:\\n![DevOps Workflow](/img/blog/devops-workflow.jpeg)\\n\\nOnce a change or new feature has been deployed, we need to operate on, to configure for example an endpoints or enable\\nthat feature using a distributed configuration system. Then we need to monitor so see how the a deployment impacts the \\nuser experience and performances. Automated the monitoring and capturing logs from the application, analyzing them in order\\nto ensure a 24/7 service availability.\\n\\nThe following cards describe some necessary practices to consider too while promoting a DevOps culture and deploying the\\ntools.\\n \\n<div class=\\"row\\">\\n  <div class=\\"column\\">\\n    <div class=\\"card\\">\\n      <h4>Microservices</h4>\\n      <p class=\\"card-content\\">Microservice architecture aims at decomposing a complex application into modules developed and understood by different people</p>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\\"column\\">\\n    <div class=\\"card\\">\\n      <h4>Infrastructure as Code</h4>\\n      <p class=\\"card-content\\">is a practice in which infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and software development techniques</p>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  \\n  <div class=\\"column\\">\\n    <div class=\\"card\\">\\n      <h4>Monitoring and Logging</h4>\\n      <p class=\\"card-content\\">\\n      Applications logs and data are collected and analyzed, and infrastructure metrics are monitored to trigger scaling up/down\\n      or respond to an unexpected event.\\n      </p>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  \\n  <div class=\\"column\\">\\n    <div class=\\"card\\">\\n      <h4>Communication</h4>\\n      <p class=\\"card-content\\">Merging development and operations efforts requires a good and seamless communication and collaboration, we can rely  on different channels like chat apps and tracking-systems</p>\\n   </div>\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n# Example: How microservices and DevOps can be implemented together to transform an application?\\nWith the adoption of microservices architecture, your pipeline could take another structure, in the following example\\nwe illustrate an old and a modern pipeline for an hotel booking application:\\n__Booking Application__ is an application that cover mainly 3 modules as follow:\\n\\n![Hotel Booking Application](/img/blog/hotel-booking-app-pipleline-v1.svg)\\n*The large Hotel Booking App team commits their changes to a single source code repository. The path from code to production is long and onerous and involves manual intervention*\\n\\nNow let\'s discover how ce can transform our hotel booking application to make it easily extensible, maintainable and continuously\\nupdated. We will decompose the monolithic application into small loosely coupled services, and put in place a modern pipeline\\nto help us respond rapidly to new requested changes and deliver quicker new versions. The figure below demonstrate the new application\\narchitecture and pipeline structures:\\n\\n![Hotel Booking Application](/img/blog/hotel-booking-app-pipleline-v2.svg)\\n*The microservices-based application consists of a set of small, decoupled services, developed, tested and deployed independently thanks to a fully automated CI/CD*\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**NOTE**\\nIn the above figure, we mention gitlab CI/CD as our continuous integration and deployment platform.We can use\\nany other combination of DevOps tools from the ones listed in previous paragraphs. \\n\\n\\nFinally, I would like to share my thoughts about DevOps, First of all is all about a culture, a change that the organization should be prepared for, I\u2019m think about people within our teams who are comfortable with old processes to deliver software, we should walk with them side by side during the promotion phase to help them understand and believe in the benefits they can gain with these new ways of creating software.\\n\\nThe second point is about the tools, today there are plenty of DevOps tools we can choose from, In my point of view having a whole one platform that provides implementations for major needed tools is extremely recommended such as CI/CD, tracking systems, code source repository, etc\u2026\\n\\nThe last point is about the word \\"continuous\\" because once we put in place these DevOps tools and spread the practices we think that the job is done but is all about continuous improvement and surely new issues will be faced and we need to be prepared to analyze and solve them again, this what engineering is about.\\n\\n----\\n* [AWS DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/)\\n* [Microservices Patterns by Chris Richardson](https://www.manning.com/books/microservices-patterns)"},{"id":"software-testing-from-separate-activity-to-core-development\\"","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/software-testing-from-separate-activity-to-core-development\\"","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-06-software-testing-from-separate-activity-to-core-development.mdx","title":"Software testing from separate activity to core development","description":"author","date":"2021-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"testing","permalink":"/blog/tags/testing"}],"readingTime":5.145,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Reda Jaifar","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/reda-jaifar","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10919693?s=400&u=b30e8e86baebe277b11a4117560d601fd34bd245&v=4","key":"reda","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"software-testing-from-separate-activity-to-core-development\\"","title":"Software testing from separate activity to core development","authors":["reda"],"tags":["testing"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"DevOps: Strengthen your digital transformation","permalink":"/blog/devops-strengthen-your-digital-transformation"},"nextItem":{"title":"Mentoring a new junior teammate from day 1 to","permalink":"/blog/mentoring-a-new-junior-teammate-from-day1-to"}},"content":"![author](/img/blog/software-testing-from-separate-activity-to-core-development.jpeg)\\n[photo source](https://www.railwaysignalling.eu/istanbul-ankara-high-speed-railway-aims-to-open-in-february2014/cropped-b-broshure-forside4-jpg)\\n\\nI remember these days when we used to write testing code after implementing the software features to make sure\\nthat the code is working, avoid bugs. Besides, we create some scripts to automate interactions with the program.\\n\\nWriting testing code was a separate activity from programming.\\n\\n# Agile redefine our testing philosophy\\n\\nWhen Agile was born in early 2000 as the fruit of a working group including Martin Fowler, The manifesto defines how agile methods\\nwill speed up the software development to bring new products to market faster. The testing activity starts taking a new\\ndefinition from a side part activity to undistinguished work of software development, Especially with \\nthe Xtreme programming method that takes the TDD as its core paradigm. We will cover in further detail the TDD in a\\ndedicated section below, but first, let\'s review the different types of tests.\\n> NB: there are plenty of test types we can code and run, in this post, I share with you only the main ones\\nfrom a developer\'s perspective. Below is a non-exhaustive list of test types:\\n\\n- Functional testing\\n- Load and stress testing\\n- Usability testing\\n- Security and Vulnerability testing\\n- Monkey testing\\n\\n## Unit tests\\nThis type of software testing covers small and isolated components of software to make sure they behave as expected,\\nNowadays these code fragments are writing by the developer itself while implementing the product\'s features. There are some\\nproperties that these tests should hold\\n- They should be fast.\\n- Run frequently as part of the continuous integration process, so they are executed after each commit.\\n- They need to be readable, Maintainable, and Trustworthy.\\n    \\n## Integration tests\\nThe main role of this type of test is to confirm that the independently developed components that compose an application\\nor a system are working as expected together. For example in a Layered architecture-based application, you may want to make\\nsure that your DAO or Repositories are working fine, or verify the web layer interactions with the business layer are matching\\nthe desired behavior, here where the integration tests come to.\\n\\nIntegration tests may cover a variety  of scenarios, here are some common ones:\\n- Testing 2 or more components interactions and data flow\\n- Verify the data sent by a component is well-formatted by another one before processing it.\\n- Verify components handle cases where they lost connectivity between them.\\n    \\n## End to End Tests\\nThey may take also the name of broad-stack tests or full-stack tests, Despite their slow time of execution they constitute\\nan important value for the product\'s quality as they test the behavior of the application in a real environment.\\nThey are intended to reproduce the end-user interaction with the product and make sure that every feature is responding as it what designed.\\nThese tests have the advantage of testing the software with all its parts connected, on the other hand, they have the\\npain of slower to run and difficult to maintain, the reason why it\'s recommended to reduce the number of these tests compared to \\nunit or integration ones as shown in the following figure:\\n\\n![the test pyramid](/img/blog/test-pyramid.png)\\n\\n# TDD: Test Driven Development\\nSince its apparition there is many books have been published, I recommend reading one or more to understand this philosophy is deep and acquire\\nsolid skills for writing tests, Here is my must-read <span>**Test Driven Development By Example**, __Kent Beck__ </span>\\n\\n>I\'ll define TDD as a programming style in which production and test code are written together, with the production code\\n> just after test one.\\n\\nBy now we have described the TDD, there are some rules to take into consideration:\\n- Rule one:     We don\'t write production code before we\'ve written a failing test.\\n- Rule two:     We don\'t write additional tests than sufficient to implement our first scenario of a use case.\\n-  Rule three:   We don\'t write more production code than needed to pass the currently failing test.\\n    \\nAs the TDD is relatively becoming a mature discipline, it started encouraging further innovations derived from it, such as BDD\\nwhose main goal is to get developers, testers, and people from the business to talk to each other. In other words \\n> the real intent is to try and work out what your customer or business wants from the software before you start working on it\\n\\nOnce we adopt the TDD and start working this way with testing side by side with production code, we\'ll write many tests\\nper use case or (feature), and more by component and you can imagine the numbers of lines we\'ll end up with,\\nmanaging tests code became as important as production one. I encourage you to keep tests clean.\\n__what makes a test clean__? Readability, shortness, and expressive. The following snippet shows an example of a test written\\nwith the intention to make it clean, but surely the is no perfect example to follow, just keep in mind to give your test code your attention.\\n```java\\n@Test\\n  public void testAcceptBooking() {\\n    // given a booking id\\n    BookingId bookingId = \\"48e58688-adc2-4e3d-be9d-f5129723b351\\";\\n\\n    // when\\n    Either<AcceptBookingError, BookingResponse> either = acceptBookingUseCase\\n                                                          .accept(bookingId);\\n\\n    // then\\n    assertThat(either.get().getStatus()).isEqualTo(BookingStatus.ACCEPTED);\\n  }\\n```\\nThere is another concept that makes our tests more readable, convenient, and easier to maintain, **Domain-Specific Testing Language**\\nThe idea is to create a set of functions and utilities to hide the details of the implementation of your test, the example above we can write\\nit this way\\n```java\\n@Test\\n  public void testAcceptBooking() {\\n    giving()\\n        ._a_bookinId()\\n    .when()\\n        .we_accept_a_booking()\\n    .then()\\n        .the_booking_should_has_accepted_status();\\n  }\\n```\\n\\nAs described by __Robert Martin__ in his book __Clean Code__ a clean test follow other rules that form the F.I.R.S.T acronym\\n\\n    - Fast: Tests shoud be fast\\n    - Independent: Tests should not depend on each other\\n    - Repeatable: Tests should be repeatable in any environment\\n    - Self-Validating: The tests should have a boolean output\\n    - Timely: Tests should be written before production code.\\n    \\nFinally, we want to think about tests as the compass to reach our destination which is the final secure, viable, and high-quality product we build.\\n\\n----\\n* [Martin Fowler\'s blog](https://martinfowler.com/testing/)\\n* [Clean Code Book by Robert C.Martin](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Martin-Clean-Code-A-Handbook-of-Agile-Software-Craftsmanship/PGM63937.html)\\n* [Cucumber Blog](https://cucumber.io/blog/bdd/intro-to-bdd-and-tdd/)\\n* [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)"},{"id":"mentoring-a-new-junior-teammate-from-day1-to","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mentoring-a-new-junior-teammate-from-day1-to","source":"@site/blog/2020-09-01-mentoring-a-new-junior-teammate-from-day1-to.mdx","title":"Mentoring a new junior teammate from day 1 to","description":"author","date":"2020-09-01T07:56:31.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"team","permalink":"/blog/tags/team"},{"inline":true,"label":"collaboration","permalink":"/blog/tags/collaboration"},{"inline":true,"label":"share","permalink":"/blog/tags/share"}],"readingTime":6.42,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Reda Jaifar","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/reda-jaifar","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10919693?s=400&u=b30e8e86baebe277b11a4117560d601fd34bd245&v=4","key":"reda","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"mentoring-a-new-junior-teammate-from-day1-to","title":"Mentoring a new junior teammate from day 1 to","date":"2020-09-01 07:56:31 +0100","authors":["reda"],"tags":["team","collaboration","share"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Software testing from separate activity to core development","permalink":"/blog/software-testing-from-separate-activity-to-core-development\\""}},"content":"![author](/img/blog/mentoring-a-new-junior-teammate-from-day1-to.jpeg)\\n[Photo by Ian Schneider](https://unsplash.com/photos/PAykYb-8Er8)\\n\\n# Teaching in my mind \\nI always love my parents\' job, I grew up in a family of two teachers, later my dad became a school principal. They were\\nsharing every day their experiences, funny situations with students, and emotions. In addition to all this\\n information about teaching, I retain one thing that I feel it\\n > Teaching others is such a satisfying feeling, especially if you can observe their progression along the time\\n\\nthese concepts were carved in my subconscious mind since then. I remember in mid-high school I went to ask about a\\n course in a private school, After introducing my self the principal proposed to me teaching Adobe Photoshop and web\\n  concepts, Without diving into the details of this journey, I do appreciate it.\\n  \\nTime passes and I find myself several times in the shoes of a teacher, the story I share in the next paragraph is\\n quite different from teaching, but has many similarities I wanted to write down.\\n \\n# Mentoring someone, who decided?\\nIn a company, this approach may be part of its culture, So the HR team once they hire a new joiner, they ask a\\n senior who wants to play the role of mentor, certainly this is a voluntary decision and not a hierarchical one, as mentoring requires first of all the initiative and passion to do it.\\n  This is not a work task to complete, this is a\\n   mindset to share with love.\\n   \\nRegardless of having this culture or not, in many cases, a spontaneous relationship between a senior and a new team\\n-member took place, mainly due to their personalities rapprochement. Then we begin to talk about mentoring as the\\n senior introduces his new team-mate to other teams, lets him discover departments, work methods, and any knowledge\\n  that may help him be  well integrated.\\n  \\n# What should we have to succeed in a mentoring program?\\nIn my opinion, we need to behave like coach  and trainee, or like teacher and student. As a mentor, Having this\\n passion for knowledge sharing, feeling so satisfied while seeing others growing up, Being generous when it comes to\\n  advising and guiding are all \\"must-have\\" values we believe in. Regarding skills, we need to be good in\\n   communication, the capacity of thought, and patience.\\n  \\n  On the other side, the trainee needs some skills, or call them behaviors like being good\\n   listener, a hungry man who wants to enrich his knowledge by asking for details, but certainly without disturbing\\n    the mentor, Because this one is meanwhile an employee with tasks and missions to complete, So as a trainee we keep\\n     calm and patient when we don\'t have some information or answers immediately. For the trainee the mentoring\\n      should represent an opportunity to know more, have different points of view, but in any case should impact\\n       our analysis capabilities, and influence our decision-making, we have to protect our autonomous which is\\n        the most valuable goal we target. \\n\\n# Day 1\\nI\'ve been delighted to welcome with my team our new colleague who has just graduated and he is today starting his\\n first job as a software engineer. I took him for a short tour to discover the office, the facilities, and our\\n  beautiful kitchen corner where often we share coffee time.\\nI think the first impression is very important the reason why my team and I gave it all our intention to make it at\\n the same time funny and useful for our team-mate. We wanted to help him feel very comfortable. For today apart\\n  from receiving his laptop and tools no code or pull request.\\n \\n# Day 2 \\nA short introduction to explain the project views, our work methods, and collaboration best practices we believe in\\n within our entity. As a software engineer focusing on technical staff, I suggested putting our junior colleague in\\n  touch with our scrum master for the purpose to learn about agility, how we use SCRUM as a reference with all its\\n   rituals from daily stand up to sprint retrospective.\\n   \\nNow it\'s coffee time, a good moment to show him an important value within our company, generosity especially when it\\n comes to knowledge, we believe that sharing is such a powerful value that helps all of up to grow up together and\\n  progress whatever our field of expertise. Although everyone has a clear and well-defined role within the team, being\\n  aware of what others are doing is crucial cope with any absence or unavailability.\\n\\n# Day 3\\nOur new colleague is very motivated and curious, his questions are dept and constructive, but unfortunately, I could\\n not answer all of them immediately, I let him know that he can also email me and I\'ll answer him later once I finish\\n  a prioritized task. The lesson here is very simple, a question may be answered later but should never end up\\n   without any response. To avoid any confusion or lack of trust that may affect my relationship with my junior\\n    colleague. \\n   \\n# Day 4\\nCollaboration over delegation is what happens when we have less time to explain or teach someone else how to complete\\na task or do a job, but this approach is too bad. As a mentor, I prefer to collaborate with trainees walking together\\nside by side armed with passion and patience with one goal: helping him being autonomous instead of completing tasks\\nfor him quickly no matter how much time will take, training others is always a pleasure and a must-have for a mentor.\\nA mentor should walk side by side with a trainee helping being autonomous instead of completing tasks for him quickly\\n> A mentor should walk side by side with a trainee helping being autonomous instead of completing tasks for him quickly\\n    \\n# Day 5\\nAre you a good listener? I was convinced as a mentor I need to listen a lot to my trainee, give him all the time to \\nexplain his point of view or vision even though I\'m not okay with or I\'m not sure he is not on the right way, keep calm\\nand let him finish, I see many colleagues when a junior comes with a new idea, or an initiative, they quickly try \\nto crop believing that is it a wast time, Unfortunately, this behavior may dramatically degrade a junior\u2019s \\nself-confidence and his motivation for future initiatives.\\n   \\n#  Next Day\\nThe days go by one after the other and I\u2019m getting so happy to see our team growing up and how our new junior colleague\\nis taking over subjects and becoming autonomous, This trusted and honest relationship we built together is bringing\\nwhat is expected to be. I do believe that mentoring someone else is nothing other than giving him the right \\nand the necessary tools to dive alone with confidence into any subject. This friendly relationship helps us learn\\nfrom each other, I do appreciate supporting my colleague during his first days within our team and in the company.\\nHis questions, exchanges, and remarks let me learn how to communicate and explain my ideas and point of view at a \\nlow level using simple and easy expressions to understand when talking to a debutant person or someone outside of \\nmy field of expertise.\\n   \\n# It\'s been a constructive journey\\nAlong the way, I learned a lot of things and values I would like to summarize below:\\n\\n    * Stay humble when you talk to junior or debutant people.\\n    * There is always something to learn from others whatever their expertise level.\\n    * Share and publish your knowledge to help serve and improve yourself and others.\\n    * Gain respect and recognition\\n    \\n*publish, share, exchange to help serve, shape and improve the world*"}]}}')}}]);
