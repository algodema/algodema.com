### The Challenge

Despite significant investments in AI pilots and prototypes, organizations often face hurdles such as:

- **Lack of Strategic Alignment**: AI initiatives that don't align with business goals fail to deliver expected ROI.
- **Operational Silos**: Disconnected teams hinder the seamless integration of AI solutions.
- **Skill Gaps**: A shortage of expertise in AI and data engineering impedes progress.
- **Fragile Workflows**: Complex and unrepeatable processes make scaling difficult.
