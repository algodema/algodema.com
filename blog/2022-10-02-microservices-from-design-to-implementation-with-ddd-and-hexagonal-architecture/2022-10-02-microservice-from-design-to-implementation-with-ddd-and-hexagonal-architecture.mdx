# Design

## Use case

In this paragraph, we gather the requirements from a business perspective before discussing how architectural patterns and software approaches can help build a product.

> Today, local grocery stores need to visit large distribution companies or call them one by one to check prices, stock availability, and delivery times in order to purchase merchandise.  
> This process consumes a lot of time and effort for grocery managers, which is why we want to address this pain point by building a platform where managers can check prices and stock levels, order merchandise, and monitor deliveries.

## Personas and User Journey

To build a system that addresses the right issues and adds real value, every part of the system should be designed with the users in mind. That's why it's crucial to understand them well, their frustrations, motivations, and expectations for this new product we are building.

* **Grocery Manager**
    * **Profile:** Typically has a bachelor's degree.
    * **Frustrations:** Running out of stock, lack of visibility over deliveries, price comparison is a time-consuming task.
    * **Motivations:** Save management time, focus on customer relationships and service quality, ensure stock levels are always adequate.

# Architecture & Design

In the previous section, we presented a brief overview of the business domain, requirements, and one of the system's future users. At this stage, we need to make architectural and design decisions.

## Architectural Style

While the brainstorming outputs are limited for this example, we can easily imagine different services: Order Service, Provider Service, Delivery Service, and Product Service.  
Now, imagine we want to build all these services in parallel, with different development teams specializing in different tech stacks. We want these services to remain decoupled from each other, so a change in one service's design doesn't impact the others.  
When it comes to **deployment**, we want to be able to deploy the __Product Service__ before the others to bring value as soon as possible. This implies that services should be deployable independently and scalable.

Also, by organizing our product around services, we can ensure fault tolerance. For instance, if the Delivery Service is down, users should still be able to use other services. For all these reasons, we are convinced that a **microservices architecture** is the right architectural style for this project.

## Domain Design 

The complexity of the business domain, the rules, and the number of services (system components) lead us to consider Domain-Driven Design (DDD). So, what is DDD?

:::info

DDD, as described in the excellent book *Domain-Driven Design* by Eric Evans (Addison-Wesley Professional, 2003), is an approach to building complex software applications that is centered around developing an object-oriented domain model.  
A domain model captures knowledge about a domain in a form that can be used to solve problems within that domain.

:::

In traditional object-oriented design, a domain model is a collection of interconnected classes. For example:

![Figure 1](algodema_blog_bmwhaad_fig1-2024-09-29-210114.svg)

*Figure 1: Object Oriented Domain Model*

With this design,Performing operations like loading or deleting an Order object involves more than just the Order;
it includes related data like order items and delivery details. The lack of clear boundaries complicates updates, as business rules, like minimum order amounts, must be enforced carefully to maintain invariants.

This is where DDD can help, by using Aggregates
> An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects within a boundary that can be treated as a unit

Figure 2 shows a simplified version of the domain model aggregates. Designing domain model using the DDD Aggregate pattern recommand that aggregates match a set of rules:
    1. Reference only the aggregate root
    2. Inter-aggregate references must use primary keys
    3. One transaction creates or updates one aggregate

# Implementation

Now that we have designed the domain model aggregates and the achitecture implementation view __Microservices__, let's dive into the architecture logical view __Hexagonal Architecture__ , please refer to this post to learn about
[Architecture Implementation view, Hexagonal option and why we adopt it](/blog/2021-10-17-software-architecture-logical-view.mdx#the-hexagonal-architecture-style)

I'm going to use Kotlin as programming language and maven as a build tool

### Pilot feature

## Bootstrap the project

Let's consider the following feature: place order
> As a grocery manager, I need to place an order for a product so I can provision the stock
> Constraint 1: The minimum order quantity is 20.

Using maven build tool, let's create a project for kotlin.

    1. create a maven project using the following cmd (you can change group id and artifact id):
    ```shell
            mvn archetype:generate \
        -DgroupId=com.algodema \
        -DartifactId=grocery-marketplace-order-service \
        -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
        -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 \
        -DinteractiveMode=false
    ```
    2. convert the project to kotlin by replacing the src/main/java and src/test/java directories with src/main/kotlin
    3. modify pom.xml for Kotlin, JUnit, and AspectJ
    4. checkout the project on github: (https://github.com/algodema/microservices-labs/tree/main/grocery-marketplace-order-service)
    
## Implement `place order` feature using TDD

What about starting with writing a test scenario for our uese case using TDD (Test Driven Development), this approch help me immediately implement business logic,
in this case ensure no order will be created with quantity less than 20 unit.
    
    ```Kotlin
        @Test
        fun `should not place order with quantity lower than 20`() {
        
            val productId: ProductId = ProductId(UUID.randomUUID())
            val providerId: ProviderId = ProviderId(UUID.randomUUID())
            val quantity: Int = 16

            val orderCreated = placeOrder.invoke(productId, providerId, quantity)

            Assertions.assertEquals(orderCreated.state, OrderState.PLACED)
        }
    ```

I started by creating "PlaceOrderFeatureTest" test class, then writing my first test as we see in the snippet above. If we look at the project structure in figure below:
![Figure 3](order-service-project-structure-1.png)

:::note
Under the package domain, I created two sub packages, features and models. Models contains the representations of our domain models such as Order, OrderId, ProductId, OrderState. Where features sub package
contains our features classes, for now we have: PlaceOrderFeature.
Note that under the models packages, we group classes under the same bussiness concern.
:::

The approach used is declaring productId, providerId, and placeOrder instances before their classes exist then gradually create those classes and organizing them into packages 
following the hexagonal architecture principles putting the business logic at the center (represented by the domain package).

We continue writing tests, they should be fixed and failed as we implement the business requirements in our place order feature.

## Infrastructure implementation

Now that we created our first feature, we would like to expose it through a REST API endpoint, but also persist the created Order
in a storage, for the purpose of this tutorial, we will implement a __in-memory__ persistence.

The hexagonal architecture defines ports and adapters as interfaces and implementations consequentially used to make the domain interacting and connecting with other components of the application such as (persistency, api, messaging, ...)

:::note
A __port__ defines a set of operations and is how the business logic interacts with what's outside it. For our example in kotlin these ports are a Java/Kotlin Interfaces.
An __adapter__ handles requests from the outside world, or the business logic by invoking an external application or service (database, message broker, ...).
Both ports and adapters could be seperated into inbound and outbound to differentiate request to business logic and requests inoked by it.
:::

:::warning
Ports will reside in the same root package as domain because they are integrated part of it. For our example: com.algodema.grocery.markeplace.domain.ports
As mentioned before, we separate them into 2 distinct sub packages:
    * com.algodema.grocery.markeplace.domain.ports.inbound
    * com.algodema.grocery.markeplace.domain.ports.outbound

Where adapters reside in the infrascture root package that we create to group all infrastcutures adapters such as:
    * REST API controllers classes
    * InMemory, Postgres or any other Repository implementations that serve to persist data.
    * External Systems integration such as SAPClient for example.
:::

Let's create the follwing ports and adapters:

    1. OrderRepository as an outbond port.
    2. PlaceOrder as inbound port.
    3. OrdersApi as inbound adapter that will use PlaceOrder port to expose the feature as REST API endpoint.
    4. InMemoryOrderRepostory as an outbound adapter that will implement the OrderRepository port interface.

Below we created the InMemoryOrderRepository class that implements the domain port OrderRepository interface, Note also that we annotate this class
with the Spring framework @Repository in order to make it discoverable by Spring IoC container. Remember that we use Spring at the infrastcuture level without any coupling with the domain.

```kotlin
    package com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice.infrastructure.spi

    import com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice.domain.models.order.Order
    import com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice.domain.ports.outbound.OrderRepository
    import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository

    @Repository
    open class InMemoryOrderRepository: OrderRepository {
        override fun save(order: Order): Order {
            throw NotImplementedError("not yet implemented")
        }
    }
```

Next we will introduce Spring framework at the infrascture layer to create REST API, we rely on the Spring frameork is dependency injection to make our components connexion decoupled
Using the __Dependency Injection__ the place order feature will hold an instance of OrderRepository to save the order created, and at infrascture's api adappter the REST Controller will hold instances of our features
by dependency injection too.

:::note
This is where Hexagonal Architecture shines. We can replace Spring by any other framework for exposing REST APIs or handling persistence without modifying the code within our domain.
This decoupling keeps the domain safe, adaptable, and maintainable, allowing us to change or add new business rules independently of the infrastructure.
For example, if we decide to switch to the Quarkus framework because it is better suited for cloud-native environments, the domain remains completely unaffected.
:::

Now in order to help Spring detect our features for dependency injection purpose, we will create a new root package named __ddd__
that will contains the following Kotlin/Java annotation:

    1. Feature Annotation: marks our features classes

```kotlin
    package com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice.ddd

    @Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
    annotation class Feature()
```

Once created we use the Feature annotation to mark our place order feature with it:

```Kotlin
    @Feature
    class PlaceOrder(private val repository: OrderRepository) : PlaceOrder {
        // ...
    }
```
:::warning
As mentioned before, we are going to use Spring boot, so we need to add Spring boot and Spring Web dependencies to our project  and Spring Boot Maven plugin to the maven build plugins.
:::

Let's create the OrdersApi in the infrastructure package under the sub package api, as follow:

```Kotlin
    package com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice.infrastructure.api

    import com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice.domain.features.PlaceOrder
    import com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice.domain.models.order.Order
    import com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice.domain.models.product.ProductId
    import com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice.domain.models.provider.ProviderId
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController

    @RestController
    @RequestMapping("/orders")
    class OrderServiceApi(private val placeOrder: PlaceOrder) {

        @PostMapping
        fun placeOrder(@RequestBody placeOrderRequest: PlaceOrderRequest): Order {

            val productId: ProductId = ProductId.from(placeOrderRequest.productId)
            val providerId: ProviderId = ProviderId.from(placeOrderRequest.providerId)
            val quantity: Int = placeOrderRequest.quantity

            return placeOrder.invoke(productId, providerId, quantity)
        }

    }
```

Now we have to instrument Spring to be aware of our marked features in order to load them into it's bean container, For this purpose we create a configuration class
in a sub package config under the infrastcuture package, See below our config class:

```Kotlin
    package com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice.infrastructure.config

    import com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice.ddd.Feature
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.FilterType

    @Configuration
    @ComponentScan(
        basePackages = ["com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice"],
        includeFilters = [ComponentScan.Filter(
            type = FilterType.ANNOTATION,
            value = [Feature::class]
        )]
    )
    open class DomainInjectionConfig
```

All that remains is to convert our application's entry point class into a Spring boot application as follow:

```Kotlin
    package com.algodema.grocery.marketplace.orderservice

    import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication
    import org.springframework.boot.runApplication


    @SpringBootApplication
    open class App

    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        runApplication<App>(*args)
    }
```

You may noticed the exsistence of the keyword open that preceed App, DomainInjectionConfig and InMemoryOrderRepository classes. Here is why
:::note
In Kotlin, classes are final by default, meaning they cannot be subclassed unless explicitly marked as open.
This is different from languages like Java, where classes are open for inheritance by default unless marked as final.

In Spring Boot (and Spring Framework in general), many of its features rely on proxy-based mechanisms. These mechanisms involve subclassing beans to apply aspects like transaction management, security, lazy initialization, and other cross-cutting concerns.
For these proxy-based features to work, Spring needs to be able to create subclasses of certain beans, which means the classes need to be open.
:::

For the purpose of this exercice we decided to use the __open__ modifier to make our classes annotated with Spring not final as we have few classes,
but for large application we can use the [All-open compiler plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/all-open-plugin.html) instead of preceeding each classe required to be open with the __open__ keyword.

Finally, let's run the application either using:

    *. maven cmd:  mvn spring-boot:run
    *. Your IDE

### Conclusion
This post has walked you through the entire process of building a fully functional Microservice, from design to implementation, using DDD and Hexagonal Architecture.
My goal was to share knowledge and experiences regarding the methodology, architecture, and patterns needed to create a maintainable, extensible, and deployable Microservice. However, delivering a production-ready product requires addressing more advanced aspects. Below is a non-exhaustive list of such considerations:

    *. Api Errors Handling
    *. Application security
    *. Database persistency
    *. Api documentation

Keep in mind that no single pattern, architectural style, or programming language suits all software product requirements. It's important to focus on understanding and defining the requirements, parameters, and challenges to make the most informed and effective decisions
