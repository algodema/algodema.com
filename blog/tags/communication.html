<p>During the latest months, I’ve been asked to move from a small agile team to a large one, why? what changes should I
cope with? what obstacles to tackle and what kind of achievements we accomplished? here are the experience story and
the learned lessons</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="small-agile-team">Small Agile team<a href="#small-agile-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Small Agile team" title="Direct link to Small Agile team">​</a></h2>
<p>I&#x27;ve been part of a small agile team of 4 developers, tech-lead, UX designer, Scrum master and a Product owner. Working
with scrum method, I do believe that this team size was just perfect as the communication is too smoothly and
decision making is quick and effective. We developers were using the git flow branching strategy. A new branch is
created for each user story, commit added, pull request created and reviewed then merged into the master. Product
owner manage easily his backlog. The scrum master scheduled perfectly our scrum sessions and these one were
gainful in term of business understanding and story telling. Thanks to the great work of our UX/UI design
integrating the UI and implementing the user experience is definitely optimal thanks to sketch software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The team size was a key element to a successful journey, providing a great added value at the end of each sprint
while delivering high-quality  software with  security standards-compliant.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Communication and collaboration</h1>
<p>When is come to working together and collaborating with a team, communication is a key factor toward success. While
this is easy for a small team as we are often setting around the same table or in the same open space we communicate
orally and  directly trying always to avoid emails and chat as much as we can, but for sure without omitting to
give each  one its  private space and time to concentrate on his tasks with no disturbs. In the other hand and
once the team getting larger we first obstacles we start to face is how to communicate and exchange, even harder
for taking a decision. Another point is managing  meetings which means to manege finding rooms especially as we
are working in a co-working building then as we have to take into consideration each one is calendar. Now we
are in the meeting room with more than 12 team-mates it took longer than expected, deviation and rarely we end
up with a defined actions list assigned people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe either we are a small or a large team there are the right tools and ways to communicate, We need just to
avoid  applying the ones that work fine for a small team in the context of a  large team and vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Support and expertise</h1>
<p>One of the greatest points when you are part of a small team, is that you know each member is scope of expertise
which is very  useful and effective when it comes to coordinate whether to change a piece of code, to integrate a new
technology or document a feature. Unfortunately this advantage disappears along the way a team begins to extend and
we start to be distributed which affects our knowledge about expertise mapping in the project and for sure consume
more time to find the right source to support you.</p>
<p>I refer to Conway&#x27;s law stating about organization structure footprint on their production:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the comminication
structures of these organizations. &quot;Melvin Conway&quot;</p>
<p>In our organization we understood this quickly and thanks to our agile coach we reorganize our teams and introduced
some practices to continue delivering added value feature continuously.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="single-point-of-knowledge">Single Point of Knowledge<a href="#single-point-of-knowledge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Single Point of Knowledge" title="Direct link to Single Point of Knowledge">​</a></h2>
<p>As our team begin to grow and having many members than needed in an agile model, I observed in the lake of
coordination, close collaboration, and effective communication, new single points of knowledge taking  place in
our organization as some people with or without attention monopolize and hold in their corner some specific
knowledge or expertise which impacts the pace of productivity, innovation, and rotation.
Contrarily to the case of a small team where the knowledge and responsibilities are well shared and all members
have almost the same level of knowledge about the project which avoids the &#x27;indispensable member&#x27; obstacle and
lead to transparent and rapid rotation and delivery.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-representative-and-interface">Team representative and interface<a href="#team-representative-and-interface" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team representative and interface" title="Direct link to Team representative and interface">​</a></h2>
<p>When I was part of a small team there was a member who keeps the team informed, knows the organization’s culture,
and promotes best practices that make our entity inspiring. Often this role appears naturally cause the person playing
it holds some qualities that help him representing the team, interfacing with management contrarily in the context of
the old school team, a project manager take this responsibility. But can we have many representatives (Leaders) in
the team? In my point of view, YES as each member has a different style therefore we can boost the team’s
productivity and creativity. Shared leadership led also to reduce responsibilities stress, thrive solidarity.
For the company we observed many advantages once we made the move to this model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the the bigger picture with everyone.</li>
<li>give the company more options.</li>
<li>increase in decision making transparency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the question is can this model succeed with a large team? From my experience, this can be a huge challenge
for the management but also for immature teams who can considerably slow down the decision making.</p>
<p>I’ve been part of different teams small and large and I believe that adopting the right management style and
establishing a transparent and honest relationship whether between team members or between teams and the management
should always gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>Being the representative of your team is talking about your shared values and practices, defending your team&#x27;s decisions
and choices. But in any case shouldn&#x27;t be a position that we take over.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/software">software</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/team">team</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/communication">communication</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/agile">agile</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/organization">organization</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/a-two-months-remote-work-experience">A 2 months remote work experience</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-04-24T12:56:31.000Z">April 24, 2020</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/reda-jaifar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10919693?s=400&amp;u=b30e8e86baebe277b11a4117560d601fd34bd245&amp;v=4" alt="Reda Jaifar"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/reda-jaifar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Reda Jaifar</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Lead Developer">Lead Developer</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="author" src="/assets/images/2-months-remote-work-experience-138416f11c7e4a8713f52e22169bc3cb.jpg" width="2911" height="2305" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>March 2020 marked by many measures taken by the majority of countries in the five continents following covid-19.
My company who already allowed their employees to work from home occasionally, Now they are obliged to continue
working remotely for an undetermined time.</p>
<p>Despite many advantages remote work bring, there are some inconveniences to manage for good productivity and effective
work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="setup-my-home-desk">Setup my home desk<a href="#setup-my-home-desk" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Setup my home desk" title="Direct link to Setup my home desk">​</a></h2>
<p>As I&#x27;m working from home, I&#x27;ve never though about setting up any similar environment like the one at the office, I&#x27;ve
just being lying on the couch the whole workday or sometime I change my position a trifle.
Two weeks later I observed that my concentration and productivity is going down more and more, I tough having some
tiredness, After exchanging with a colleague, He reveal its secret for keeping energy and effectiveness, I was
surprised while hearing that setting up a similar work desk at home may highly help. I decided to take into
consideration this point, Now I confirm how this changed my home working routine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;am 100% convinced that setting up a convenient desk at home can considerably help
with commitment, concentration and effectiveness while working from home <!-- -->☺️</p>

<p>Unfortunately living in Paris or any big city around the world has its disadvantage when it comes to spacious
lodgement.
For the parents with their children at home, for the friends sharing the same room, dealing with this limitation is a
key point for relaxed home working without impacting our collaboration and performance. From my point of view, we can
manage this issue by rotating our work hours and companies should tolerate this option letting parents working while
their children are sleeping.
Overall having a private room stay the best option for enhancing what has been mentioned about setting a home desk.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="effective-communication">Effective communication<a href="#effective-communication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Effective communication" title="Direct link to Effective communication">​</a></h2>
<p>In the field of software engineering, Often discussing new technologies, good practice or some technical decision
brainstorming may be held while we are sharing a coffee with team-mates in the cafeteria, or around a table in a
meeting room, that means we have a face to face communication, In my case, I do love this way as it brings to me a
smooth and flexible tools using my body language to explain and talk about a topic.
Unfortunately while working from home this manner is no longer afford the same way we do at the office. But thanks to
recent video-conference platforms we can continue relying on our communication habits taking into consideration some
rules for en effective exchanging, follow the ones I’m using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turning my camera on during the meetings.</li>
<li>Wearing my usual clothes like in the office.</li>
<li>Using a virtual whiteboard instead of the real one to explain, share and design my ideas.</li>
<li>Turning my micro off when I&#x27;m not the speaker.</li>
<li>Summarizing your notes and sharing them with colleagues.</li>
<li>Video calls or chat over emails</li>
<li>Most important is to setup the rules with your team and colleagues to avoid disturbing each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>I noticed during the first weeks of my home working that I did not take rest and breaks regularly. So I used to
schedule meeting right away, sometimes at lunch time, sometimes I chain them without any pause. Few time later I
recognize a lack of concentration and it becomes very disturbing to see calls and meetings notification showing up.
The conclusion is working remotely does not mean working continuously and do it so may substantially impact our
physical and mental health, the reason why I decided to schedule my rest and breaks during the work day and stay
away from work during these time slots.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>While working from home, never forget to take rest and breaks during a workday as it protects us
from health risks and mental disturbance.</p>

productivity and enjoying my workday from home.</p>
