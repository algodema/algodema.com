<p>I always love my parents&#x27; job, I grew up in a family of two teachers, later my dad became a school principal. They were
sharing every day their experiences, funny situations with students, and emotions. In addition to all this
information about teaching, I retain one thing that I feel it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Teaching others is such a satisfying feeling, especially if you can observe their progression along the time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>these concepts were carved in my subconscious mind since then. I remember in mid-high school I went to ask about a
course in a private school, After introducing my self the principal proposed to me teaching Adobe Photoshop and web
concepts, Without diving into the details of this journey, I do appreciate it.</p>
<p>Time passes and I find myself several times in the shoes of a teacher, the story I share in the next paragraph is
quite different from teaching, but has many similarities I wanted to write down.</p>
<h1>Mentoring someone, who decided?</h1>
<p>In a company, this approach may be part of its culture, So the HR team once they hire a new joiner, they ask a
senior who wants to play the role of mentor, certainly this is a voluntary decision and not a hierarchical one, as mentoring requires first of all the initiative and passion to do it.
This is not a work task to complete, this is a
mindset to share with love.</p>
<p>Regardless of having this culture or not, in many cases, a spontaneous relationship between a senior and a new team
-member took place, mainly due to their personalities rapprochement. Then we begin to talk about mentoring as the
senior introduces his new team-mate to other teams, lets him discover departments, work methods, and any knowledge
that may help him be  well integrated.</p>
<h1>What should we have to succeed in a mentoring program?</h1>
<p>In my opinion, we need to behave like coach  and trainee, or like teacher and student. As a mentor, Having this
passion for knowledge sharing, feeling so satisfied while seeing others growing up, Being generous when it comes to
advising and guiding are all &quot;must-have&quot; values we believe in. Regarding skills, we need to be good in
communication, the capacity of thought, and patience.</p>
<p>On the other side, the trainee needs some skills, or call them behaviors like being good
listener, a hungry man who wants to enrich his knowledge by asking for details, but certainly without disturbing
the mentor, Because this one is meanwhile an employee with tasks and missions to complete, So as a trainee we keep
calm and patient when we don&#x27;t have some information or answers immediately. For the trainee the mentoring
should represent an opportunity to know more, have different points of view, but in any case should impact
our analysis capabilities, and influence our decision-making, we have to protect our autonomous which is
the most valuable goal we target.</p>
<h1>Day 1</h1>
<p>I&#x27;ve been delighted to welcome with my team our new colleague who has just graduated and he is today starting his
first job as a software engineer. I took him for a short tour to discover the office, the facilities, and our
beautiful kitchen corner where often we share coffee time.
I think the first impression is very important the reason why my team and I gave it all our intention to make it at
the same time funny and useful for our team-mate. We wanted to help him feel very comfortable. For today apart
from receiving his laptop and tools no code or pull request.</p>
<h1>Day 2</h1>
<p>A short introduction to explain the project views, our work methods, and collaboration best practices we believe in
within our entity. As a software engineer focusing on technical staff, I suggested putting our junior colleague in
touch with our scrum master for the purpose to learn about agility, how we use SCRUM as a reference with all its
rituals from daily stand up to sprint retrospective.</p>
<p>Now it&#x27;s coffee time, a good moment to show him an important value within our company, generosity especially when it
comes to knowledge, we believe that sharing is such a powerful value that helps all of up to grow up together and
progress whatever our field of expertise. Although everyone has a clear and well-defined role within the team, being
aware of what others are doing is crucial cope with any absence or unavailability.</p>
<h1>Day 3</h1>
<p>Our new colleague is very motivated and curious, his questions are dept and constructive, but unfortunately, I could
not answer all of them immediately, I let him know that he can also email me and I&#x27;ll answer him later once I finish
a prioritized task. The lesson here is very simple, a question may be answered later but should never end up
without any response. To avoid any confusion or lack of trust that may affect my relationship with my junior
colleague.</p>
<h1>Day 4</h1>
<p>Collaboration over delegation is what happens when we have less time to explain or teach someone else how to complete
a task or do a job, but this approach is too bad. As a mentor, I prefer to collaborate with trainees walking together
side by side armed with passion and patience with one goal: helping him being autonomous instead of completing tasks
for him quickly no matter how much time will take, training others is always a pleasure and a must-have for a mentor.
A mentor should walk side by side with a trainee helping being autonomous instead of completing tasks for him quickly</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mentor should walk side by side with a trainee helping being autonomous instead of completing tasks for him quickly</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Day 5</h1>
<p>Are you a good listener? I was convinced as a mentor I need to listen a lot to my trainee, give him all the time to
explain his point of view or vision even though I&#x27;m not okay with or I&#x27;m not sure he is not on the right way, keep calm
and let him finish, I see many colleagues when a junior comes with a new idea, or an initiative, they quickly try
to crop believing that is it a wast time, Unfortunately, this behavior may dramatically degrade a junior’s
self-confidence and his motivation for future initiatives.</p>
<h1>Next Day</h1>
<p>The days go by one after the other and I’m getting so happy to see our team growing up and how our new junior colleague
is taking over subjects and becoming autonomous, This trusted and honest relationship we built together is bringing
what is expected to be. I do believe that mentoring someone else is nothing other than giving him the right
and the necessary tools to dive alone with confidence into any subject. This friendly relationship helps us learn
from each other, I do appreciate supporting my colleague during his first days within our team and in the company.
His questions, exchanges, and remarks let me learn how to communicate and explain my ideas and point of view at a
low level using simple and easy expressions to understand when talking to a debutant person or someone outside of
my field of expertise.</p>
<h1>It&#x27;s been a constructive journey</h1>
<p>Along the way, I learned a lot of things and values I would like to summarize below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay humble when you talk to junior or debutant people.</li>
<li>There is always something to learn from others whatever their expertise level.</li>
<li>Share and publish your knowledge to help serve and improve yourself and others.</li>
<li>Gain respect and recognition</li>
</ul>
<p><em>publish, share, exchange to help serve, shape and improve the world</em></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/team">team</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/collaboration">collaboration</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/share">share</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/mentor">mentor</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/is-our-scoping-was-successful">is our scoping was successful?</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-06-22T07:56:31.000Z">June 22, 2020</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/reda-jaifar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10919693?s=400&amp;u=b30e8e86baebe277b11a4117560d601fd34bd245&amp;v=4" alt="Reda Jaifar"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/reda-jaifar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Reda Jaifar</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Lead Developer">Lead Developer</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="author" src="/assets/images/is-our-scoping-was-successful-9f759d8cee2b80b2a93014937f453985.jpg" width="1024" height="768" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>A new project is in the pipeline and we are ready to kick off this new challenge, Our team is ready and full of energy
and enthusiasm. Scoping sessions are scheduled this week.
The first session started with a short description of the project, making the focus on the business and strategic
impact and how will help the company to accelerate its digital transformation in the perspective of developing
new digital products and cloud-based offerings. It’s time to finish the workshop with one conclusion all team members
share the same frustration regarding where we want to go.
During the week these sessions succeeded one after the other and still having a blur vision, confusing features, and also
an organization that we believe is not convenient to drive the boat to the shore.</p>

<p>As a product owner, I have to gather the maximum information about the customer business, their strategic goals, and
where they want to land once the project takes off. I remember this quote from Dassault Systemes <a href="http://3ds.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dassault Systemes !</a></p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If we ask the right questions, we can change the world</p>
<p>Asking pertinent questions is crucial to understand the business and the desired value we expect to provide. For a
successful scoping workshop, this job should be prepared before and these reflections and analysis at least started
in order to keep the team members away from any frustration or defeatism.</p>

<p>The product owner is the guard of the vision and customer value, keeping the train on track requires a lot of effort
regarding the business understanding and mapping this knowledge to user stories that designers, developers are easily
able to take in charge and implement.</p>
<p>Based on our experience, our product owner iterated regularly over the backlog to refine the items and get rid of
the irrelevant ones, each time he was approached to revise a business rule.</p>

<p>What kind of format our documents should follow to write down the specifications and requirements and how many details
we should draft? this question is indispensable to answer before starting, the more we give attention to what to write
the more implementation will be easily taking into consideration all constraints and customer-specific requirements
such as solution’s time responding, availability, number of future users. These notes help considerably when it comes
to architecture design and technical stack decisions.</p>

<p>While in agile project continuous delivery is at the heart of it and shouldn’t be part of discussions but the frequency
of delivery and type of deliverable could be, The reason why a team should agree and state early these points.</p>
<p>The adoption of continuous improvement is totally appreciated while the business is evolving but we have to pay attention
before investing in this area causes often lead to delivery postponed even contract issues.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cost">Cost<a href="#cost" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cost" title="Direct link to Cost">​</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes and due to technical choices such as licences, do not forget to include them in your budget estimation and
let stakeholders know about them, When it comes to money transparency is the key to spread trust and avoid
undesirable surprises. the rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>calculate an accurate budget and make sure all elements are included.</li>
<li>define a process that helps to keep the budget flexible regarding features without over budgeting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="communication">Communication<a href="#communication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Communication" title="Direct link to Communication">​</a></h2>
<p>Whatever the project scope or size, communication is a key to a successful customer value and team satisfaction, Defining
communication channels, rules, and tools between stakeholders and project team can considerably impact project
progression and target achieving. Communication also implies some values such as transparency about the team’s
capabilities what we can and we cannot do, these kinds of statements should be communicated as soon as possibl
to help the customer make the best decision.</p>
<p>In my point of view, I prefer to avoid the usage of multiple communication tools and formats with our
stakeholders (telephone, email, video-conference, meetings…), this can help keep our exchanges simple, effective.</p>
<p>Regarding internal communication between team members, Personally, I have a lot of appreciation for meetings
or face-to-face discussion believing that is the quick and right way to argue a decision or explain a point of view
to convince my team-mates of any technical choice. Otherwise using a project management tool to track and monitor
is still very useful in order to keep everyone updated and everything documented.</p>

<p>Agile practices come to solves today’s project issues and pains, but at any stage, we should be wedged, In my opinion, we have
to cope with challenges, involve the team in every decision, think differently and act like one. Scoping is the stage
where we invite all involved people to the same boat with one goal is to reach the destination.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/software">software</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/agile">agile</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/engineering">engineering</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/workflows">workflows</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/practices">practices</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/methods">methods</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/processes">processes</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/from-small-team-to-large-one">From small team to large one</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-05-22T12:56:31.000Z">May 22, 2020</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/reda-jaifar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10919693?s=400&amp;u=b30e8e86baebe277b11a4117560d601fd34bd245&amp;v=4" alt="Reda Jaifar"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/reda-jaifar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Reda Jaifar</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Lead Developer">Lead Developer</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="author" src="/assets/images/from-small-team-to-large-one-d5313349378962c9d6f3c995ea09095b.jpeg" width="940" height="615" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>During the latest months, I’ve been asked to move from a small agile team to a large one, why? what changes should I
cope with? what obstacles to tackle and what kind of achievements we accomplished? here are the experience story and
the learned lessons</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="small-agile-team">Small Agile team<a href="#small-agile-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Small Agile team" title="Direct link to Small Agile team">​</a></h2>
<p>I&#x27;ve been part of a small agile team of 4 developers, tech-lead, UX designer, Scrum master and a Product owner. Working
with scrum method, I do believe that this team size was just perfect as the communication is too smoothly and
decision making is quick and effective. We developers were using the git flow branching strategy. A new branch is
created for each user story, commit added, pull request created and reviewed then merged into the master. Product
owner manage easily his backlog. The scrum master scheduled perfectly our scrum sessions and these one were
gainful in term of business understanding and story telling. Thanks to the great work of our UX/UI design
integrating the UI and implementing the user experience is definitely optimal thanks to sketch software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The team size was a key element to a successful journey, providing a great added value at the end of each sprint
while delivering high-quality  software with  security standards-compliant.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Communication and collaboration</h1>
<p>When is come to working together and collaborating with a team, communication is a key factor toward success. While
this is easy for a small team as we are often setting around the same table or in the same open space we communicate
orally and  directly trying always to avoid emails and chat as much as we can, but for sure without omitting to
give each  one its  private space and time to concentrate on his tasks with no disturbs. In the other hand and
once the team getting larger we first obstacles we start to face is how to communicate and exchange, even harder
for taking a decision. Another point is managing  meetings which means to manege finding rooms especially as we
are working in a co-working building then as we have to take into consideration each one is calendar. Now we
are in the meeting room with more than 12 team-mates it took longer than expected, deviation and rarely we end
up with a defined actions list assigned people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe either we are a small or a large team there are the right tools and ways to communicate, We need just to
avoid  applying the ones that work fine for a small team in the context of a  large team and vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Support and expertise</h1>
<p>One of the greatest points when you are part of a small team, is that you know each member is scope of expertise
which is very  useful and effective when it comes to coordinate whether to change a piece of code, to integrate a new
technology or document a feature. Unfortunately this advantage disappears along the way a team begins to extend and
we start to be distributed which affects our knowledge about expertise mapping in the project and for sure consume
more time to find the right source to support you.</p>
<p>I refer to Conway&#x27;s law stating about organization structure footprint on their production:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the comminication
structures of these organizations. &quot;Melvin Conway&quot;</p>
<p>In our organization we understood this quickly and thanks to our agile coach we reorganize our teams and introduced
some practices to continue delivering added value feature continuously.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="single-point-of-knowledge">Single Point of Knowledge<a href="#single-point-of-knowledge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Single Point of Knowledge" title="Direct link to Single Point of Knowledge">​</a></h2>
<p>As our team begin to grow and having many members than needed in an agile model, I observed in the lake of
coordination, close collaboration, and effective communication, new single points of knowledge taking  place in
our organization as some people with or without attention monopolize and hold in their corner some specific
knowledge or expertise which impacts the pace of productivity, innovation, and rotation.
Contrarily to the case of a small team where the knowledge and responsibilities are well shared and all members
have almost the same level of knowledge about the project which avoids the &#x27;indispensable member&#x27; obstacle and
lead to transparent and rapid rotation and delivery.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-representative-and-interface">Team representative and interface<a href="#team-representative-and-interface" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team representative and interface" title="Direct link to Team representative and interface">​</a></h2>
<p>When I was part of a small team there was a member who keeps the team informed, knows the organization’s culture,
and promotes best practices that make our entity inspiring. Often this role appears naturally cause the person playing
it holds some qualities that help him representing the team, interfacing with management contrarily in the context of
the old school team, a project manager take this responsibility. But can we have many representatives (Leaders) in
the team? In my point of view, YES as each member has a different style therefore we can boost the team’s
productivity and creativity. Shared leadership led also to reduce responsibilities stress, thrive solidarity.
For the company we observed many advantages once we made the move to this model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the the bigger picture with everyone.</li>
<li>give the company more options.</li>
<li>increase in decision making transparency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the question is can this model succeed with a large team? From my experience, this can be a huge challenge
for the management but also for immature teams who can considerably slow down the decision making.</p>
<p>I’ve been part of different teams small and large and I believe that adopting the right management style and
establishing a transparent and honest relationship whether between team members or between teams and the management
should always gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>Being the representative of your team is talking about your shared values and practices, defending your team&#x27;s decisions
and choices. But in any case shouldn&#x27;t be a position that we take over.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/software">software</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/team">team</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/communication">communication</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/agile">agile</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/organization">organization</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/a-two-months-remote-work-experience">A 2 months remote work experience</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-04-24T12:56:31.000Z">April 24, 2020</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/reda-jaifar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10919693?s=400&amp;u=b30e8e86baebe277b11a4117560d601fd34bd245&amp;v=4" alt="Reda Jaifar"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/reda-jaifar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Reda Jaifar</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Lead Developer">Lead Developer</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="author" src="/assets/images/2-months-remote-work-experience-138416f11c7e4a8713f52e22169bc3cb.jpg" width="2911" height="2305" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>March 2020 marked by many measures taken by the majority of countries in the five continents following covid-19.
My company who already allowed their employees to work from home occasionally, Now they are obliged to continue
working remotely for an undetermined time.</p>
<p>Despite many advantages remote work bring, there are some inconveniences to manage for good productivity and effective
work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="setup-my-home-desk">Setup my home desk<a href="#setup-my-home-desk" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Setup my home desk" title="Direct link to Setup my home desk">​</a></h2>
<p>As I&#x27;m working from home, I&#x27;ve never though about setting up any similar environment like the one at the office, I&#x27;ve
just being lying on the couch the whole workday or sometime I change my position a trifle.
Two weeks later I observed that my concentration and productivity is going down more and more, I tough having some
tiredness, After exchanging with a colleague, He reveal its secret for keeping energy and effectiveness, I was
surprised while hearing that setting up a similar work desk at home may highly help. I decided to take into
consideration this point, Now I confirm how this changed my home working routine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;am 100% convinced that setting up a convenient desk at home can considerably help
with commitment, concentration and effectiveness while working from home <!-- -->☺️</p>

<p>Unfortunately living in Paris or any big city around the world has its disadvantage when it comes to spacious
lodgement.
For the parents with their children at home, for the friends sharing the same room, dealing with this limitation is a
key point for relaxed home working without impacting our collaboration and performance. From my point of view, we can
manage this issue by rotating our work hours and companies should tolerate this option letting parents working while
their children are sleeping.
Overall having a private room stay the best option for enhancing what has been mentioned about setting a home desk.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="effective-communication">Effective communication<a href="#effective-communication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Effective communication" title="Direct link to Effective communication">​</a></h2>
<p>In the field of software engineering, Often discussing new technologies, good practice or some technical decision
brainstorming may be held while we are sharing a coffee with team-mates in the cafeteria, or around a table in a
meeting room, that means we have a face to face communication, In my case, I do love this way as it brings to me a
smooth and flexible tools using my body language to explain and talk about a topic.
Unfortunately while working from home this manner is no longer afford the same way we do at the office. But thanks to
recent video-conference platforms we can continue relying on our communication habits taking into consideration some
rules for en effective exchanging, follow the ones I’m using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turning my camera on during the meetings.</li>
<li>Wearing my usual clothes like in the office.</li>
<li>Using a virtual whiteboard instead of the real one to explain, share and design my ideas.</li>
<li>Turning my micro off when I&#x27;m not the speaker.</li>
<li>Summarizing your notes and sharing them with colleagues.</li>
<li>Video calls or chat over emails</li>
<li>Most important is to setup the rules with your team and colleagues to avoid disturbing each other.</li>

<p>I noticed during the first weeks of my home working that I did not take rest and breaks regularly. So I used to
schedule meeting right away, sometimes at lunch time, sometimes I chain them without any pause. Few time later I
recognize a lack of concentration and it becomes very disturbing to see calls and meetings notification showing up.
The conclusion is working remotely does not mean working continuously and do it so may substantially impact our
physical and mental health, the reason why I decided to schedule my rest and breaks during the work day and stay
away from work during these time slots.</p>

<p>While working from home, never forget to take rest and breaks during a workday as it protects us

<p>It&#x27;s sound strange at first, difficult to manage, and certainly understanding the
reasons behind and how can we take advantage of this practice introduced a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Mob programming is an approach introduced to the agile world in the purpose of helping the teams
establish a common development mindset, sharing the same principles to design and code.</p>
<p>A few months ago my team and I started a new project aiming at providing a digital platform
for developers to help them accelerate their time to market. The platform  offers a multiple<br>
<!-- -->services such as creating web application scaffold, source code repositories, build pipeline
with all high-quality stages like security check, team management and deployment environment.</p>
<p>Obviously the project size is enormous and requires a high quality architecture design,
distributed systems best practices and synchronous coding styles so during the scoping and framing
phases we decided to adopt the mob programming approach to share and communicate architecture decisions,
lean our performances with the goal to promote our autonomy when it comes to developing user stories
independently or separately.</p>
<p>our mob programming sessions are scheduled for the whole workday for 4 weeks consecutive,
we team up in the same room having only one keyboard and one big screen. Each developer takes control
of the keyboard and code for 10 minutes. I believe that respecting the mob programming rules
is a key to success in this experience which is full of learning for developers but also for the
quality of the product as we build together the skeleton.</p>
<p>I would like to share with you all the rules we followed during our sessions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>having a comfortable and spacious room with all the necessary tools like big screen and a mechanic keyboard <!-- -->✌</li>
<li>defining roles before each session, we&#x27;ve had the Driver who types in code and Navigator who discuss the idea
and guide the Driver.</li>
<li>respecting timing is a key, it&#x27;s better to hand the keyboard over with a broken test than overtaking.</li>
<li>we&#x27;ve been driven by basic user stories at the beginning in order to focus on technical architecture.</li>
<li>we discuss, debate and argue our ideas when we think they are right, no one or idea should be discarded.</li>
<li>Believing that there no strict model or perfect one to follow, a retrospective is held weekly to evaluate our mob
programming enrollment.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Before experiencing the mob programming I was asking my self how can will be productive by letting 8 developers to
work on the same thing for weeks, I confess how was am I surprised by what we were able to deliver,
a full feature bringing a real added value to our customers. If you ask me for the secret the only answer I have
is we were doing the work the most perfect way it could, avoiding broking the build, hard merges, and enduring
exchanges by emails or pull requests to agree on a design, interoperability, components communication, and best
practice adoption. In addition discussing ideas and approaches helped us a lot to select the best ones.</p>
<p>During these sessions, we build a wonderful team spirit, communication protocols, and a homogeneous mindset. without
omitting the impact on our motivation and commitment. I was really happy with this journey and the results harvested at
the end.</p>
<p>I highly recommend giving this approach a try even though for a short time, I consider practicing is the best way to
understand, evaluate and conclude if it could bring the right expectations for your team.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/software">software</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/engineering">engineering</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/agile">agile</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/team">team</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/collaboration">collaboration</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/mob-programming">mob programming</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/a-five-years-journey-of-software-engineering">A 5 years journey of software engineering</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-03-10T12:56:31.000Z">March 10, 2020</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/reda-jaifar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10919693?s=400&amp;u=b30e8e86baebe277b11a4117560d601fd34bd245&amp;v=4" alt="Reda Jaifar"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/reda-jaifar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Reda Jaifar</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Lead Developer">Lead Developer</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="author" src="/assets/images/5-years-journey-of-software-engineering-6b7ae3c428733d0fb22fb5c1f0f99155.jpeg" width="1024" height="640" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Just another story of a software developer that has been started 5 years ago officially by getting my first job within the 3D Modeling Software leader provider worldwide as a junior software developer with a lot of passion and energy to write lines of code and make an impact but for sure at this stage, I can&#x27;t see it because it wasn&#x27;t about creating my mobile application that millions of people around the world are using or my web application with many active users a day, but a few years later it is and the product I worked on is making a great success and despite my modest contribution I do proud of this work no matter I left the company looking forward new challenges in a completely different sector.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was working with a group of friends on a platform, dreaming of reinventing the food making and delivery, we started developing &quot;otchi&quot; a web and mobile application for sharing meals and creating recipes but 7 months later we give on the project up and decided to stop investing our free time on this wonderful project, I confess this failure was very disappointing but I told my self &quot;Hey! how can you ignore all the stuff you learned, it&#x27;s just another try why not to repeat&quot;. late 2017 I joined a medical equipment manufacturer to develop software that runs on these different machines from Scanners to MRI and you can imagine that excitation I&#x27;m experiencing to start such mission with this sentence in my head</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;m going to develop software that runs on medical equipment helping in saving lives and bring smiles to those who
are suffering from some diseases.</p>
<p>During this experience, I learned a lot about software development, first time to use the agile methods &quot;SCRUM&quot;, go on production quickly and communicating with users directly, their feedbacks and comments were useful, I realized that a software developer should never be like staying at the corner of your open space implementing user stories, and whether you are developer, tester or product owner this human interaction is mandatory to well understand the needs and bring the right added value instead of delivering features.</p>
<p>Yes! I&#x27;m leaving this job, this company, this role, I&#x27;m leaving my manager because even within the best technical environment a developer can work in and enjoy his collaboration we cannot avoid the conflicts when it reaches a closed door. This time the lesson is simple as &quot;human first and I&#x27;m leaving for the interest of everybody not to run away from the confrontation&quot;</p>
<p>I do appreciate all the conflict discussions I&#x27;ve had with my manager because we debated <strong>ideas</strong> and visions, not
personas and behaviors.</p>
<p>Hopefully, a few months ago from writing these lines, I landed in the right place I was always looking for, Here we believe that culture and values are very important and working with people with who share the same insights and attitudes is not just titles that we put on company&#x27;s website but that is part of everybody&#x27;s mindset.</p>
<p>Here at my current job, we develop MVPs and squads are completely autonomous for their stack and architecture choices meanwhile we all teams within this happy community are using agile methods convinced that these methods not only increases productivity but also facilitates project management, improves the quality of work and makes flexible change possible.</p>
<p>It was about sharing my career path until now in a short story, I do like to call it a journey with the faith that our job
is part of our overall life, not an only professional one, this is why I&#x27;ll always trying to do it with <strong>passion</strong>
, and surrounded with analogous and complementary <strong>people</strong>.</p>
<p>#learning is a never-ending story</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/software">software</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/engineering">engineering</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/impact">impact</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/path">path</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/collaboration">collaboration</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/people">people</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/passion">passion</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">algodema</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="http://www.algodema.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">About us<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/legal-notice">Legal notice</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/algodema" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Linkedin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/algodema" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Github<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 algodema</div></div></div></footer></div>
