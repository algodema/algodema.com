# Navigating the Tech Jungle: How a Technology Radar Guides Smart Choices

In today’s fast-evolving software landscape, staying updated with the latest tools, frameworks, and practices is both a challenge and an opportunity. One powerful way to stay on top is by using a **Technology Radar** — a curated, visual map that helps teams make smart technology decisions.

If you want to build software that lasts, you need a compass to guide you. Let’s explore what a technology radar is, why it matters, and how adopting one can transform your team’s approach to technology.

## What Is a Technology Radar, Anyway?

Imagine a radar screen showing all the tech options — from emerging tools on the edge to proven stalwarts in the center. It visualizes:

- **Tech you should adopt now**
- **Tech you should evaluate or trial**
- **Tech to keep an eye on**
- **Tech to avoid**

By plotting tools, frameworks, and practices into these rings, a radar clarifies which are ready for production, and which are hype or dead ends.

This transparency empowers teams to align around shared technology decisions — avoiding fragmentation or chasing every shiny new thing.

## A Living, Breathing Technology Radar

A technology radar is not a static list but a **living document**, regularly updated by tech leads and experts. It categorizes technologies across different domains:

- Programming Languages  
- Frameworks & Libraries  
- DevOps Tools  
- Cloud Platforms  
- Testing & QA Tools  
- And more  

Each tech is assigned to one of four rings:

- **Adopt**: Mature, proven, recommended for immediate use.  
- **Trial**: Promising tech worth evaluating in projects.  
- **Assess**: Worth watching but not yet ready.  
- **Hold**: Technologies that have issues or are becoming obsolete.  

This methodical approach brings clarity to choices, reduces risk, and encourages innovation responsibly.

## Why Your Team Needs a Technology Radar

1. **Encourages Strategic Technology Adoption**  
With so many options, it’s tempting to jump on the latest trends. A radar prevents impulse decisions by grounding tech adoption in research and experience.

2. **Facilitates Communication and Alignment**  
Developers, architects, and management get a shared language and framework for discussing tech. This helps break down silos and build consensus.

3. **Improves Onboarding and Knowledge Sharing**  
New team members quickly grasp what’s recommended, what’s experimental, and what’s off-limits — reducing onboarding friction.

4. **Supports Continuous Improvement**  
By reviewing the radar regularly, teams keep learning and adapting, staying relevant without chaos.

## How To Build Your Own Technology Radar

Here’s a simple approach:

- **Form a cross-functional team:** Include engineers, architects, QA, and product owners.  
- **Define radar categories:** Pick domains relevant to your stack and projects.  
- **Collect tech candidates:** Gather inputs from projects, hackathons, experiments, and community buzz.  
- **Evaluate and classify:** Use criteria like maturity, adoption, risk, and business value.  
- **Publish and update regularly:** Keep it visible and alive — review every 3-6 months.

## Putting Your Technology Radar Online: Step-by-Step Tutorial

Building your technology radar is just the first step. Sharing it effectively across your organization is key to its success.

One efficient way to do this is by using an open-source Technology Radar website project that visualizes your radar interactively and attractively.

Here’s a detailed guide on how to deploy your own radar website using this project.

---

### Step 1: Clone the Radar Website Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AOEpeople/aoe_technology_radar.git
cd aoe_technology_radar
```

## Step 2: Prepare Your Radar Data

Inside the repository, you’ll find a directory for data (commonly `src/data` or similar) with files in YAML or JSON format describing your radar contents.

### Example structure:

```yaml
rings:
  - name: Adopt
  - name: Trial
  - name: Assess
  - name: Hold

quadrants:
  - name: Languages & Frameworks
  - name: Tools
  - name: Platforms
  - name: Techniques

items:
  - name: React
    ring: Adopt
    quadrant: Languages & Frameworks
    description: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

  - name: GraphQL
    ring: Trial
    quadrant: Tools
    description: A query language for APIs.
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies and Run Locally

The radar site typically uses **Node.js** and **React**. Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start a local development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or specified port) to preview your radar live as you make changes.

## Step 4: Customize the Radar Website

You can modify:

- **Colors and styling**: Update CSS or theme files to match your brand.
- **Content**: Add more metadata or links to technology items.
- **Layout**: Adjust quadrant names, rings, or add new features.

The project is designed to be easily extensible and customizable — check the `README` and source code for further options.

## Step 5: Build and Deploy

When you’re happy with your radar, build the static files:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates production-ready HTML, CSS, and JS files in the `build` folder.

You can deploy these files to any static web host, such as:

- **GitHub Pages**
- **Netlify**
- **Vercel**
- **Your company’s internal web server**

### For example, to deploy on GitHub Pages:

1. Create a GitHub repository for your radar site.
2. Push your built files to the repository’s `gh-pages` branch (or configure as needed).
3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings.


## Real-World Benefits of a Technology Radar Website

Publishing your radar online:

- Makes tech decisions transparent and accessible  
- Encourages team engagement and contributions  
- Provides a central reference point for all stakeholders  
- Supports continuous updates without complicated distribution  

Teams using a tech radar website report faster decision cycles, better alignment, and more confident adoption of new technologies.

## Final Thoughts

In an ever-shifting technology landscape, a **Technology Radar** acts as a vital compass for your software journey. By thoughtfully building, maintaining, and sharing your radar through a user-friendly website, you create a culture of strategic tech choices and continuous improvement.

If you want to stay ahead of the curve, start your own technology radar today — and empower your team with clarity and confidence.
